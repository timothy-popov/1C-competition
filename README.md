# 1C-competition
Aeroponic farm website and database application code

This project is for storing code written for competition. It represents two interconnected applications: website and so called data base for a hypothetical farm. The website is for selling farm products to customers. The database is actually ERP.

All code is written on a technology named 1C:Element. There are some features that can be implemented to improve apps and their interaction, but I doubt that somebody will be interested in this.
